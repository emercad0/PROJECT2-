Some Idea's -  
## The Rise of music streaming services - 
We could probably put together this visual using a pie chart. We can start this as an empty full circle with an introduction of our story. 
 Then the pie chart would transition to a complete visual that shows purchasers of physical/digital copies, and the list of music streaming in 2010. Then we would transition to current year.  
  We can include a button to switch through the years and make changes to the data on the pie chart. We will continue this until we have a pie chart that represent data of 2018  
  The order in which the music services appear would be based on the number of current subscribers from lowest to highest
## Informative Guide of Breweries in Charlotte - 
I was thinking for this one we could probably create an SVG file of the inside of the most popular brewery in charlotte. 
	We would use that img as a background for our page, and then add a selection of top beers to the counter 
	and finally we would add a list to a section of the page that includes the breweries in charlotte
	
## List of the top 100 data broker companies with the kind of information that they collect. 
We would probably need to crawl this unless we can find an article. So we could scrape the internet for this data
Then we can clean and organized the data, then create a table and generate it on the bottom half of the page.
On the top half we could probably create a couple slides highlighting the details

# Project Description: 
For this second project, your task will be to "tell a story" through data visualizations. 

Unlike the first project, where you focused on using the "Analytics Paradigm" to explore relationships in "report form", this project should be more focused on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves. 

Just as with the first project, you will be asked to conduct a 10 minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data munging techniques, and final visualization.

You may choose a project of any theme, but we encourage you to think broadly. The universe is wide and expansive. Don't limit yourself to what you know. 


# Specific Requirements 
Your visualization must include a Python Flask powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)

Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks: 
A custom "creative" D3.js project (i.e. non-standard graph or chart)

A combination of Web Scraping and Leaflet or Plotly

A dashboard page with multiple charts all updating from the same data

A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)

Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.

Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
